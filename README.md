# Traffic-Violation-System

# These are not the complete files of the project...

I used You Only Look Once Version 5 (YOLO V5) to detect traffic violations such as helmet violations and triple riding. Based on the license plate number— which is extracted using optical character recognition (OCR)—we notified the violator about the challan via mail using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and attached a substantial proof to the email.
